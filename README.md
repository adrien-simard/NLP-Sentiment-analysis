# NLP-Sentiment-analysis
We can place ourselves in a situation where the government would like to follow political trends and find out if the population has a positive opinion on the country's politics.

The dataset consists of comments on Danish political articles on social media. The comments have a positive or negative score depending on their content. It would then be interesting to be able to make a model that would automatically classify (positive or negative) comments. 

# Run the program
We have two R notebooks: 
- The first contain the linear Regression
- the second the Neural network 
To run the code only you need to install the required packages and run the entire notebook
